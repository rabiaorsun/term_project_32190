# Environmental and Socioeconomic Factors Affecting Lung Cancer: A Comparative Study of India and Canada
# 1. Introduction #
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with environmental and socioeconomic factors playing a significant role in its prevalence. This study aims to compare lung cancer incidence in India and Canada, analyzing how various environmental, occupational, and socioeconomic factors contribute to the disease. The goal is to identify patterns, risk factors, and potential areas for intervention to reduce lung cancer rates in both countries

# 2. Motivation #
Understanding the factors influencing lung cancer can help policymakers and healthcare professionals develop better prevention strategies. India and Canada have stark differences in air quality, smoking rates, healthcare access, and economic conditions, making them ideal for a comparative study. This project will provide valuable insights into how these differences impact lung cancer trends.

# 3. Project Goals #
- Analyze historical air and water pollution levels,smoking data and the other factors in India and Canada
- Identify correlations between datas and lung cancer incidence rates
- Comparing the data between India and Canada, which are very different from each other, in order to ensure that the level of pollution might affect lung cancer.
- Use statistical techniques to evaluate the significance of these correlations
- Visualize trends and findings effectively
- Provide insights into possible policy recommendations
-  # In general:
      - This project aims to highlight the far-reaching consequences of environmental pollution. Comparing India, a country struggling with high pollution levels, to Canada, which has significantly cleaner          air and water, allows for a deeper understanding of how different environmental conditions impact public health. Through this research, we hope to shed light on the need for comprehensive pollution          control measures that address both air and water quality. This study will provide insights into how different living conditions contribute to lung cancer prevalence. Through this research, we hope 
        to emphasize the importance of targeted public health policies, pollution control measures, and improved healthcare accessibility in mitigating lung cancer risks.
        
# Data Source #
The data for this study will be collected from multiple publicly available sources:

#### **Environmental Factors**
- **Air Pollution:**
  - **Global Air Pollution Dataset:**  WHO, AQI datasets, government pollution monitoring agencies (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO2 levels). In this data we have 12 column in this data I will just use India 
  and Canada rows. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibalmuzdadid/global-air-pollution-dataset(Kaggle)
  - **India:** In this data there are 16 columns which shows the air quality by looking at each month information sets. In this dateset I will just use for India in order to show further the pollution.
