# Air Pollution, Water Pollution, and Lung Cancer: A Comparative Study of India and Canada

# Motivation #
Air pollution and water pollution which is mostly caused by air contamination are two major environmental challenges that have significant health impacts worldwide. Studies have shown that ongoing exposure to poor air quality can lead to respiratory diseases, including lung cancer, while contaminated water sources can further exacerbate health risks. This project explore the intricate relationship between air pollution, water pollution, and lung cancer incidence in two distinct countriesâ€”India(low air and water quality) and Canada(high air and water quality). By comparing these two nations with contrasting environmental policies, pollution levels, and healthcare infrastructures, we seek to understand how these factors influence public health outcomes. Through this study, we hope to provide data-driven insights into the role of environmental pollution in lung cancer cases, contributing to better policymaking and public awareness.

# Project Goals #
- Analyze historical air and water pollution levels in India and Canada
- Identify correlations between pollution levels and lung cancer incidence rates
- Comparing the data between India and Canada, which are very different from each other, in order to ensure that the level of pollution might affect lung cancer.
- Use statistical techniques to evaluate the significance of these correlations
- Visualize trends and findings effectively
- Provide insights into possible policy recommendations
-  # In general:
      - This project aims to highlight the far-reaching consequences of environmental pollution. Comparing India, a country struggling with high pollution levels, to Canada, which has significantly cleaner          air and water, allows for a deeper understanding of how different environmental conditions impact public health. Through this research, we hope to shed light on the need for comprehensive pollution          control measures that address both air and water quality.

# Data Source #
The data for this study will be collected from multiple publicly available sources:
- **Global Air Pollution Dataset(Kaggle):**  WHO, AQI datasets, government pollution monitoring agencies (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO2 levels). In this data we have 12 column in this data I will just use India and Canada rows. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibalmuzdadid/global-air-pollution-dataset
- **World's Air Quality and Water Pollution Dataset(Kaggle):** UN water quality reports and air quality levels. In this data there are 5 colums. I will just use India and Canada rows in this dataset.

- **Lung Cancer Rates(World Health Organization) :** National health statistics, research papers (cancer incidence by region). In this data there are 6 columns. I will just use India and Canada rows.

- **Asia's 2023 Air Report(Kaggle) :** In this data there are 16 columns which shows the air quality by looking at each month information sets. In this dateset I will just use for India in order to show further the pollution. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shruthiiiee/asia-2023-air-report-2000-cities
