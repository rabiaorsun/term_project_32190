# Environmental and Socioeconomic Factors Affecting Lung Cancer: A Comparative Study of India and Canada
# Introduction #
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with environmental and socioeconomic factors playing a significant role in its prevalence. This study aims to compare lung cancer incidence in India and Canada, analyzing how various environmental, occupational, and socioeconomic factors contribute to the disease. The goal is to identify patterns, risk factors, and potential areas for intervention to reduce lung cancer rates in both countries

# Motivation #
Understanding the factors influencing lung cancer can help policymakers and healthcare professionals develop better prevention strategies. India and Canada have stark differences in air quality, smoking rates, healthcare access, and economic conditions, making them ideal for a comparative study. This project will provide valuable insights into how these differences impact lung cancer trends.

# Project Goals #
- Analyze historical air and water pollution levels,smoking data and the other factors in India and Canada
- Identify correlations between datas and lung cancer incidence rates
- Comparing the data between India and Canada, which are very different from each other, in order to ensure that the level of pollution might affect lung cancer.
- Use statistical techniques to evaluate the significance of these correlations
- Visualize trends and findings effectively
- Provide insights into possible policy recommendations
-  # In general:
      - This project aims to highlight the far-reaching consequences of environmental pollution. Comparing India, a country struggling with high pollution levels, to Canada, which has significantly cleaner          air and water, allows for a deeper understanding of how different environmental conditions impact public health. Through this research, we hope to shed light on the need for comprehensive pollution          control measures that address both air and water quality. This study will provide insights into how different living conditions contribute to lung cancer prevalence. Through this research, we hope 
        to emphasize the importance of targeted public health policies, pollution control measures, and improved healthcare accessibility in mitigating lung cancer risks.
# Hyphotesis  #
# - H0 (Null Hypothesis):
-There is no significant relationship between environmental/socioeconomic factors and lung cancer incidence.

# -HA (Alternative Hypothesis - senin main hipotezin):
-Environmental and socioeconomic factors significantly affect lung cancer incidence rates.

### üîç Data Analysis

**1. Data Preprocessing**
-Datasets from multiple sources ‚Äî including air pollution, water pollution, smoking rates, healthcare access, population, and lung cancer incidence ‚Äî were collected and compiled.
-First we determine the effect of each attribute to outcome within each country
-All datasets were filtered to include only India and Canada, allowing for a focused comparative analysis.
-The data were aligned by year and country, and merged into a single unified dataset for analysis.
-Missing data were cleaned and handled appropriately using techniques such as interpolation or mean imputation.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
-The distributions of all independent variables were examined (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO2, water pollution index, smoking rates, healthcare spending).
-Separate time-series plots were created for India and Canada to visualize environmental and socioeconomic trends.
-Preliminary observations showed that India has generally higher levels of air and water pollution, along with elevated smoking rates, compared to Canada.

**3. Correlation Analysis**
-The relationships between each independent variable and lung cancer incidence were measured using Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients.
-Correlation matrices were generated to assess the strength and direction of associations.
-Notably, PM2.5(I named it "Air Pollution" based on the information) and smoking rates exhibited a positive correlation with lung cancer rates, suggesting that these factors may be significant contributors.

**4. Regression Modeling**
-A Multiple Linear Regression model was constructed to determine which factors most significantly impact lung cancer incidence.
-Dependent variable: Lung Cancer Incidence Rate
-Independent variables: Air Pollution, water pollution index, smoking rate, healthcare access, population over age 65
The model was evaluated using:
  - correlation value is calculated
  - p-values to test the statistical significance of each factor.

**5. Visualization**
-Heatmaps were used to visually represent correlations between all variables.
-Scatter plots were created to illustrate the relationships between individual variables and lung cancer incidence.
-Box plots compared average values of key variables between India and Canada.

**Comparision Table**


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88ac205d-9057-4605-ad69-253768d5051d)

-üìå Interpretation 

  -All five variables show statistically significant relationships with lung cancer mortality in India (p < 0.05).

  -Tobacco Use and Air Pollution have strong negative correlations, suggesting that as these factors increase, lung cancer mortality tends to rise.

  -Health Expenditure and Doctors per 1,000 exhibit strong positive correlations, implying that as healthcare access improves, mortality rates also increase ‚Äî which may seem counterintuitive. This could reflect a lag effect or improved diagnosis/reporting in better-funded systems.

  -Water Pollution also shows a significant negative relationship.

**Comparision Table**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6ea0d0a-2d21-478e-ae12-8c5c477ced29)

-üìå Key Observations:

  -Tobacco Use:
A very strong positive correlation (œÅ = 0.835) suggests that increased tobacco use is strongly associated with higher lung cancer rates. This is one of the most critical factors influencing the disease.


  -Air Pollution:
Shows a moderately strong positive correlation (œÅ = 0.659), supporting the idea that poor air quality significantly contributes to lung cancer incidence.


  -Water Pollution:
Displays a weaker but still meaningful positive correlation (œÅ = 0.587), indicating environmental pollution in general is a relevant factor.


  -Health Expenditure:
Strong negative correlation (œÅ = -0.811) suggests that higher investment in healthcare is associated with lower lung cancer rates, possibly due to better prevention and early diagnosis.


  -Doctors per 1,000:
The most negative correlation (œÅ = -0.841), indicating that greater healthcare accessibility (measured by medical staff availability) is strongly linked to lower incidence rates.


## **After examining each country individually, we conducted a comparative analysis of all variables between India and Canada to look at the difference.**##

**Summary**
> The chart shows a contrasting trend in lung cancer mortality between Canada and India over time.  
> While Canada demonstrates a steady **decline**‚Äîlikely due to effective tobacco control policies, early diagnosis, and better healthcare‚ÄîIndia exhibits a **consistent increase**, suggesting a growing environmental and public health burden.  
> By 2020, India surpasses Canada in lung cancer mortality, highlighting the urgent need for policy intervention, especially around pollution and tobacco control.

**üìåAs a result** :Based on the correlation analysis results where p-values were consistently below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ).  
Thus, we accept the alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ), concluding that environmental and socioeconomic factors significantly affect lung cancer incidence rates.

## üß† Machine Learning Analysis: Country-Specific Modeling of Lung Cancer Mortality

To explore the relationship between environmental and socioeconomic factors and lung cancer mortality, we developed supervised machine learning models using country-separated datasets for **India** and **Canada**. Instead of combining the two countries, we trained models individually, aiming to capture regional patterns more effectively and avoid misleading generalizations.

We utilized four regression models:
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

Each model was evaluated using **5-Fold Cross-Validation** to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting.

## Interpretation & Insights

- **India models outperformed Canada‚Äôs across all algorithms**, likely due to stronger correlations or less variance in India‚Äôs data.
- **Linear Regression and Random Forest** yielded near-perfect results for India, confirming strong linear patterns and interaction effects.
- For Canada, **KNN performed best**, suggesting localized trends that simple linear models missed.
- **Healthcare infrastructure variables** (doctors per 1,000, health expenditure) contributed meaningfully alongside pollution and smoking-related variables.
- **Decision Trees struggled with Canadian data**, possibly due to smaller sample size or noisier relationships.

---

## Limitations & Future Work

- Data is limited to two countries; broader international data could improve generalizability.
- Non-linear models like **XGBoost** or **Neural Networks** could further capture hidden patterns.
- **Feature importance analysis** and **SHAP values** would provide deeper insights into variable influence.
- Temporal patterns were not analyzed. A panel or time-series approach could identify lag effects from pollution or public health interventions.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

By splitting modeling tasks across countries and applying rigorous cross-validation, we‚Äôve shown that **context-aware models** yield more accurate, interpretable results. The approach highlights the importance of both environmental and healthcare-related factors in predicting lung cancer mortality ‚Äî and sets the stage for broader, global modeling in future work.
